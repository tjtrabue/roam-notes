# Roam Notes

This is my personal `org-roam` notes repository. If you don't know, Roam is an
interesting note-taking system where you associate information nodes (i.e.,
files or topics) with one another. This stands in stark contrast to most
note-taking systems, which are usually hierarchical in nature. Making
information hierarchical certainly makes nesting and parsing easier, but much is
lost, as well. By treating your notes like a directed graph, it becomes possible
to reason about the connections between pieces of information.

`org-roam` is an _implementation_ of the Roam note-taking system, utilizing Org
mode's existing powerful features to complement the concepts of Roam.
